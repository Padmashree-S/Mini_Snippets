# Mini_Snippets

Heyya! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Mini_Snippets, a curated collection of bite-sized code snippets and mini projects I've crafted along my data journey. Whether itâ€™s a clever logic puzzle, a handy algorithm, or a small project â€” from the basics to more complex challenges â€” youâ€™ll find them all here in one place.

This repository serves as my personal playground and learning diary, where I experiment, explore, and refine my coding skills across different domains. Itâ€™s a growing space, and Iâ€™m excited to keep adding to it as I continue to learn and evolve.

Feel free to browse, use, or contribute! Every snippet tells a story of curiosity and problem-solving, and I hope it sparks ideas for you too.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
